# About *Rooted Light: The Spiritual Ecology of the Garden*

*Rooted Light: The Spiritual Ecology of the Garden* is a book written by **Michael Bradford**, exploring the living relationship between Nature, the human spirit, and the intelligence that weaves them together. It draws on decades of ecological gardening experience, community work, and direct observation of natural systems to offer a vision of renewal â€” both environmental and inner.

The book is structured around the **four seasons**, each representing a phase in the garden and in consciousness:
- **Spring â€” Emergence**  
- **Summer â€” Growth and Illumination**  
- **Autumn â€” Transformation and Harvest**  
- **Winter â€” Reflection and Return**

Through these cycles, *Rooted Light* blends **practical ecological knowledge** with **spiritual insight**, guiding readers to reconnect with the living Earth as teacher, mirror, and kin.

### ðŸª´ Philosophy and Purpose
At its core, *Rooted Light* explores what it means to live in resonance with the natural world â€” to perceive the garden not as a static environment but as an unfolding field of relationship and intelligence. It proposes that tending soil, seeds, and ecosystems can also cultivate coherence within the self.

### ðŸ”§ Connection to AutoAg and Regenerative Technology
The ideas in *Rooted Light* also inform the **AutoAg Project**, an ongoing exploration of AI and smart agricultural systems designed to work *with* ecological rhythms rather than against them. This repository bridges those two worlds â€” creative and technical â€” by showing how the philosophy of spiritual ecology can inspire intelligent, ethical, and sustainable design.

### ðŸ§­ Authorâ€™s Note
I created this space to share selected excerpts and essays from *Rooted Light* as part of my interdisciplinary portfolio â€” integrating my work as a **writer, technologist, and regenerative grower**.
